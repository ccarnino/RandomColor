RandomColor
===========

Swift extension of UIColor to provide methods to generate random colors.

In the UIColor extension I've added two class methods:

	// Purely random color
	UIColor.randomColor()						
	
	// Create a new tone of a specified starting color
	UIColor.randomToneByColor(color: UIColor)

In the test project you can test the two methods


# Installation
Download the code and add to your project the file **RandomColorExtension.swift** . Start to use the new class methods.
